# Task.4-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression-
# What I Did (Steps):

1. Loaded the dataset and checked basic info.
2. Explored the target class with a quick plot.
3. Split the datainto train and test sets (80-20 split).
4. Standardized the features using `StandardScaler`.
5. Trained a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated the model using:

   * Confusion matrix ✅
   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall ✅
   * ROC curve + AUC ✅.
7. Played around with threshold tuning to see how it changes results.

# What I Learned:

* How logistic regression works (uses sigmoid function).
* How to evaluate binary classifiers with multiple metrics.
* ROC-AUC is super useful to understand performance across thresholds.
* Tuning threshold can help depending on whether you want fewer false positives or false negatives.
